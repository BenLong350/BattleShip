**2023 Project Synergy Internship**

This is Ben and Philip's Battleship game. This is the big project we produced to show our progress in Python over the span of the internship.

**Directions:**

-Run the program Battleship.py.py                                                                                                                                                                                      
-Read each prompt and respond to each respective prompt                                                                                                                                                                
-Tell the program where you want your ship to be on your board and try to guess where the enemy's (NPC) ship is on their board.
